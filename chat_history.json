Implement navigation from the home screen to the music playback screen when a music file is selected.\n4.  Implement basic playback controls (play, pause) on the music playback screen.\n5.  Modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n6.

To add real local file support, you would need to:\n\n1. Request media library permissions\n2. Scan device for audio files using expo-media-library\n3. Replace the mock data with real file data\n\nThe interface is fully in Russian as requested, and follows modern mobile app design principles with smooth animations and a clean, breathable layout."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-03T22:53:15Z"}]
