I've successfully implemented the top songs functionality for your music player app. Here's what I've added:\n\n## New Features:\n\n### 1. **Top Songs Tracking System**\n- **Song Statistics Service** (`services/songStatsService.ts`): Tracks play counts and date added for each song\n- **Enhanced Song Type**: Added `playCount`, `dateAdded`, and `lastPlayed` fields\n- **Persistent Storage**: Uses AsyncStorage to save song statistics\n\n### 2. **Top Songs Sections**\n- **Recently Added Songs**: Shows songs sorted by when they were added to the app\n- **Most Played Songs**: Shows songs sorted by play count (most popular)\n- **Visual Rankings**: Each song shows its rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) in the top lists\n\n### 3. **Enhanced UI Components**\n- **TopSongsSection Component**: Beautiful sections with icons, titles, and \"View All\" buttons\n- **Updated SongItem**: Now supports compact mode and ranking display\n- **Play Count Tracking**: Automatically increments when a song reaches 30% completion\n\n### 4. **Smart Statistics**\n- **Automatic Tracking**: Songs are automatically added to stats when first loaded\n- **Play Count Logic**: Only counts as a \"play\" when the song reaches 30% completion\n- **Time-based Sorting**: Recently added songs show relative time (e.g., \"2\u0434\", \"5\u0447\", \"30\u043c\")\n\n### 5. **Profile Integration**\n- **Clear Statistics Option**: Added a debug option in the profile to reset all song statistics\n- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental data loss\n\n## Key Features:\n\n- **\ud83d\udcca Recently Added Section**: Shows the latest songs added to your library\n- **\ud83c\udfb5 Most Played Section**: Displays your most listened-to tracks with play counts\n- **\ud83d\udd22 Visual Rankings**: Each song shows its position in the top lists\n- **\ud83d\udcf1 Responsive Design**: Works beautifully in both light and dark themes\n- **\ud83d\udcbe Persistent Data**: All statistics are saved and persist between app sessions\n- **\ud83d\udd04 Auto-refresh**: Statistics update automatically as you listen to music\n\n## How It Works:\n\n1. **When you add songs**: They're automatically tracked with the current timestamp\n2. **When you play songs**: Play count increments after 30% completion\n3. **Top lists update**: Rankings refresh automatically based on your listening habits\n4. **Visual feedback**: See your most played songs and recently added tracks at a glance\n\nThe app now provides a much richer music experience with personalized recommendations based on your listening patterns! \ud83c\udfb6"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-03T23:06:41Z"}]
